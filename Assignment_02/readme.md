**Assignment 2 - Inverse Kinematics of DDMWR**                                          Sai Balaji Jai Kumar

**Description of the Problem and Solution**  

Problem Description: In this assignment, the goal is to develop two C++ files, mydriver and mycontroller, that control a mobile robot using ROS. The mydriver constantly publishes the goal_pose (x, y, Î¸), and the mycontroller implements a simple differential drive inverse kinematics to determine the robot's path.

Steps Taken to Solve the Problem:

1.I analyzed the assignment description and requirements to understand the problem.
1.I wrote two C++ files, mydriver.cpp and mycontroller.cpp, to implement the required functionality.
1.I created a launch file, assignment02.launch, to execute both nodes simultaneously.
